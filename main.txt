                I am currently a user interface and experience apprentice at Nashville Software School with a penchant for both web and
                print based graphic design.  I also love philosophy and self-knowledege, so when I found out that I could excercise logic, 
                empathy and my skills in art and design to provide beautiful interfaces and intuitive experiences to users, I knew I had found
                my calling.
